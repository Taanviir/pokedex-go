## Development

### Structure

- **CLI Commands**: Defined in the `cliCommand` struct.
- **Input Parsing**: Inputs are cleaned and tokenized using `cleanInput`.
- **REPL Loop**: Runs in the `startRepl` function to process user inputs continuously.

### Adding New Commands
To add a new command, follow these steps:
1. Create a new function with the signature `func(*config, ...string) error`.
2. Add the command to the `getCommands` function with its name, description, and callback.

Example:
```go
"newcommand": {
    name:        "newcommand",
    description: "Description of the new command.",
    callback:    newCommandFunction,
},
```

### Dependencies
- **Go Modules**: Ensure Go modules are enabled to manage dependencies.
